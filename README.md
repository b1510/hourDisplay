HourDisplay for CHROME
----------------------
   

Why did I develop this ?
------------------------

I use the dual-screen at work and at home. I often have a program in full screen on the main screen (movies, series, games, etc ...) and a browser on the other.
I wanted a way to tell the time without any clicks. The way I've found is to develop an extension for the Chrome browser that displays the time simply.

My working base
---------------

A sample from google code

Improvement
